This project is a PDF-based Question Answering System which enables individuals to submit any PDF document and ask questions related to its content. The AI analyses  the text within the uploaded File and offers correct, context-aware replies. This is especially beneficial for research papers, reports, manuals, textbooks, and other documents where users want to get a short overview without reading the entire content.
